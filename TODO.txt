#TODO
0. Documentation (possible with RDOC)
1. Refactor CSS files according to the Decorator pattern — with overrides for different effects (content genres like ebook, doc, etc)
4. I can pass args to Convertinator on the command line?
5. Convertinator as a gem.

NEW API:

* convert_file(filename)
* convert_dir(dirname)
* convert_project

All three place the output inside the root dir.

Images are stored at root level, regardless of the level of content that includes the images. 

#DONE
0. Traverse all dirs recursively from root, printing their names 
1. Traverse and concatenate all files into a single .mdown file
2. As above, but convert the final file to .html
3. I can pass a directory (one or more levels deeper than the current one) as an argument
4. I can pass an individual file (again, any level deep) as an argument
5. The script constructs the final .html file completely, with header (<head></head> etc) and footer.
6. PDF generation with Prince and Pandoc.
7. Tests for files with composite names pass.
8. Add print / pdf stylesheets to Convertinator build (for PDF docs).
9. Issuing shell commands from Ruby (Ruby runs Pandoc), one single pipeline out of multiple steps
1. Tests for PDF generation
2. Converting single files to PDF
0. Place output files relative to 'img' directory — on both per-file and per-project level. 
0. New naming convention troughout

![Autumn leaves](img/autumn-leaves.jpg "Autumn leaves")
![Autumn leaves](./img/autumn-leaves.jpg "Autumn leaves") 

^ both work:

This converts .md to .pdf on the CL:
$ pandoc --pdf-engine=prince -s -o doc.pdf convertinator.mdown 

Unstyled, though — add styleshet on the CL (look up WW)

These two both include images. Problems:

1. .md to .pdf does not parse the Markdown
2. images are oversized in both, likely because they're unstyled.

Main takeaway: run the 'pandoc' command from the root dir.

MD -> PDF
$ pandoc --pdf-engine=prince --css=build/lib/css/pdf.css -s -o from-md.pdf convertinator.mdown 

HTML -> PDF
$ pandoc --pdf-engine=prince --css=build/lib/css/pdf.css -s -o from-html.pdf convertinator.html

BINGO. Problem solved.
