#TODO

0. Place output files relative to 'img' directory — on both per-file and per-project level. Image paths are not thought out well. 
4. I can pass args to Convertinator on the command line?
5. Convertinator as a gem.

NEW API:

convert_dir(startdir)
-> places output inside the input dir

(What if the dirs are nested? At which level do you place the images?) 

convert_file(path)
-> places output inside the input dir 

convert_project
-> places output inside the root dir 

#DONE
0. Traverse all dirs recursively from root, printing their names 
1. Traverse and concatenate all files into a single .mdown file
2. As above, but convert the final file to .html
3. I can pass a directory (one or more levels deeper than the current one) as an argument
4. I can pass an individual file (again, any level deep) as an argument
5. The script constructs the final .html file completely, with header (<head></head> etc) and footer.
6. PDF generation with Prince and Pandoc.
7. Tests for files with composite names pass.
8. Add print / pdf stylesheets to Convertinator build (for PDF docs).
9. Issuing shell commands from Ruby (Ruby runs Pandoc), one single pipeline out of multiple steps
1. Tests for PDF generation
2. Converting single files to PDF
