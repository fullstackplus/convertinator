#TODO
Read up on passing args to command line scripts. 

#DONE
0. Traverse all dirs recursively from root, printing their names 
1. Traverse and concatenate all files into a single .mdown file
2. As above, but convert the final file to .html
3. I can pass a directory (one or more levels deeper than the current one) as an argument
4. I can pass an individual file (again, any level deep) as an argument
5. The script constructs the final .html file completely, with header (<head></head> etc) and footer.
